I changed my careers so many times that my family and friends are probably really concern that I have developed multi-personalities. But in my defense, I honestly just didn't know what it is that I really wanted to do, until I wrote my first line of code and everything changed, for the better. 

My journey to Software Engineering has been a long yet interesting journey with a handful of twists and turns. 

Ever since I was six, I thought I wanted to do when I grow up. I wanted to become a Doctor. I'd often sign my name as Dr. Dinh, instead of my first name. That goes to tell you how serious and commited I was. I graduated top in my class. I took mostly honor and AP classes for Math and Science. I got a scholarship and got in early for my pre-Med program. I thought I was set. But the summer between my High School graduation to Freshmen year in College, I decided to get an unpaid internship in the field, just to confirm if it's something that I wanted for the next 8 years of my life. To my surprise, I hated it. 

I bet my entire life on this plan so I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do next. Nothing sparked my interest. I thought I shouldn't be wasting $35,000/year in tuition AFTER my scholarship (without my scholarship, my tuition would have been $55,000/year) just to do some 'soul searching'. So, I did the next logical and responsible thing: I withdrew. 

I was lost, but I figured I should do something, whatever it is, just something. I tried just about everything and nothing really stuck. 

I was a Retail Manager. 
I was a Bookkeeper. 
I was a Property Manager. 
I was an Optometric Assistant.
I was a door-to-door Salesperson. 
I was a Wedding Photographer. 
I was a Reseller. 

I can keep going, but I won't, because I am embarassed as I am listing everything now. See. I wasn't kidding earlier when I said I changed my career so many times. 

I was so unhappy, frustrated, and angry at myself for not knowing what it is that I wanted to do. But, I knew that I wanted more out of my life. I also know that I am super introverted. I know that I am good at solving problems. One random night, I googled: "high-paying jobs for introverts who are good at problem solving". I read through that list and two things that jumped at me: Paralegal and Software Engineer. 

Around this time, I decided to move from Seattle, WA to San Francisco Bay Area. I worked with a Staffing Agency because I just moved and I didn't really know what the Bay Area is like. They sent me an invite for an interview for a "Technical Talent Acquisition Specialist". I thought: "Tech? What the heck? I read over the company's profile and I was blown away. I wanted the job, BAD! But I didn't have any technical background, so to prepare for the interview, I figured I should at least know how to code or how technology works (I know, I was so naive about the tech scene). 

I turned to Google again. I watched and read all the articles about Talent Acquisitions strategies, this specific company, and concluded that Python is something that I should learn. I signed up for Codecademy and just went to town with it. The whole time, in my head, I thought: "wow, it's actually not as intimidating as I thought". I had fun. I enjoyed it. Eight hours flew by and it just felt like 2 hours. 

They ended up making me an offer on the spot. From this experience, I later on landed a position with Amazon Web Services, where I had more exposure to the Tech Scence, access to amazing career mentors, and technical mentors. With their encouragement, I decided to sign up for Flatiron Bootcamp and take this journey more seriously. My goal is to become a Front-End Engineer at AWS by June 2020. 

I cannot wait to embark on this journey.
