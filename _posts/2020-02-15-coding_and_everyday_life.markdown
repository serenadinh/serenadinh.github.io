Commonalities between coding and my everyday life. 

Before I started my Coding Journey, everyone warned me that it's going to be a tough, challenging, yet rewarding journey at the same time, so I could properly prepare for what's a head of me. 

Well, they weren't wrong, but I have to say that I love it so far and there are skills that Coding has taught me beyond just writing codes. 


If you work in Tech, even non-tech jobs, come with unique sets of problems. When I encounter a problem that would normally take me longer to solve than I would have liked, I tend to just give up, jump to the next things to work, and the vicious cycle just never ends. I don't know if it's because that I am impatient or because I didn't go about solving a problem effectively, which caused frustration and made me quit. Maybe it's a combination of both. 

But...

## The Ability To Solve Problems Effectively 
Coding taught me to approach a problem the right ways: 

I learn to understand the requirements first before I should start solving it. If I don't have enough information about the end goal of a project, it's on me to reach out to people, ask questions, and collect the right information, enough for me to have idea of what my plan should be, instead of shooting aimlessly without having a target. That's not efficient, either. 

The second thing is to come up with a roadmap, sometimes, severals, because there're mutlitple ways to solve a problem. Weight the pros and cons. Be decisive. Commit to a plan. Get it done. 

I learn to sit with a problem instead of giving up. This skill alone has helped me finish so many half-baked projects for years! 



## Patience and Compassion
I learn to let go of being perfect. This one is problem the biggest lesson for me. I normally don't jump in with both feet until I feel like I "know" everything. Truth is, I will never know everything and nothing will never be perfect. Clarity comes from actions. I just have to keep trying, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. With coding, there're so many trials & errors. It's a constant grinding frustration. Even the most seasoned Software Engineers still don't have all the answers. Letting go of perfectionism and accepting that has helped me so much of making progress in my Coding journey, my life, and my career. 

## It's Okay to Ask Questions 
I am naturally a really shy person. I am usually afraid of asking questions because I feel like I am bothering others. Worst, for the longest time, I felt embarassed to ask questions because I was afraid that it makes me look incompetent or less than. Truth is, that's not true at all, especially in the Programming world. People are always willing to help.

Programming is like learning a new language and I feel like a toddler again who asks questions every other 10 minutes or so because it's a whole new world to me. When I open up with my coworkers, friends, family, and others, it's insane to see the support system that I have. Everyone is willing to help. It's okay to ask questions. In fact, it's a good thing to ask questions so that I can avoid all the confusion and misunderstanding. I learn from asking questions too. I learned to ask the RIGHT questions. 

The more I open up about my journey to become a Software Engineer, the more support I receive. My manager is supper supportive. She assigned me with an Engineering Group and the Director on that Engineering Group is also supportive. They both were so glad when I told them that I am trying to become a Software Engineer. They assigned me a mentor who's a woman and she's a Senior Software Engineer who's been helping me with any hiccups I may have throughout this journey. Had I not ask questions or open up, I wouldn't receive this blessing at all!
